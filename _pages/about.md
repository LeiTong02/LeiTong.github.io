Greetings! My name is Zhihua Liu. I am currently a Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. Huiyu Zhou at the Biomedical Image Processing Lab (BIPL) in the School of Informatics, University of Leicester. I am funded by the Graduate Teaching Assistantship of School of Informatics. Previously, I was a software engineer in JD Logistics, JD.com. I received my M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 2016, my B.Eng. in Internet of Things from University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2015. I spent my undergraduate final year at the School of Computing  in University of Dundee, supervised by Prof. Stephen McKenna, Dr. Sebastian Stein and Prof. Jianguo Zhang. My research is focusing on computer vision and machine learning especially in deep learning and medical image analysis.
