About Me
======
Greetings! I am Lei Tong (Chinese: 童磊). I am currently a Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Huiyu Zhou](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics/people/huiyu-zhou) at the [Biomedical Image Processing Lab (BIPL)](https://sites.google.com/site/huiyujoe/) in the School of Informatics, University of Leicester. I am funded by the Graduate Teaching Assistantship of College of Science and Engineering, University of Leicester and the Studentship of AstraZeneca Cambridge.

Previously, I received my M.Phil. in Computer Science from the University of Leicester in 2020, my B.S.c. in Computer Science from Zhejiang University, Ningbo Institute of Technology in 2017. I spent my undergraduate final year at the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Queen's University Belfast. 

My research is mainly focusing on computer vision and machine learning, especially in biomedical image analysis, open set learning.
